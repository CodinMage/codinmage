            Software testing is a process of examining the artifacts and the behavior of software under test, whether in a business or educational context. It can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation.

            Software testing is the process of examining a software program or application, as well as its associated test data, and determining if a particular test has passed. Software testing examines the artifacts and behavior of the software under test and ensures that it conforms to the intended specifications.

            Software testing is an important activity in any software development process. As the name implies, software testers ensure that software meets defined and agreed-upon requirements. When they are done properly, they can help make sure that an application is easily used by potential users and provides satisfactory performance in the real world.
